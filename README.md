Hello, I'm @Ajay Paterson
I'm interested in becoming a Web Developer and have recently enrolled in a continuing educaiton program at the University of Alberta to learn about this.
I'm currently learning Git, GitHub, HTML, and Web Design
I'm looking to collaborate on any basic level coding work as I'm just a beginner.
You can reach me ajay.paterson@gmail.com
