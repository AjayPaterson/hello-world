# About Me
Hi, I'm **@AjayPaterson** and I'm currently enrolled in the continuing education program at the University of Alberta for Web Development. 

My educational background is a bit all over the place, starting with Music Performance, Commerce/ Management, Project Management.  

Recently I've been exposed to projects that have me diving into the tech sector!  Although I'm relatively new to this, I'm a life-long learner and would eventually like to make a career change into the industry.
